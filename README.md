# Stand-alone ESP32 clock

This is a prototype for exploring the twin rendering code on the ESP32
WROVER KIT which kinda got away from me. The result is a
network-synchronized clock which uses the 320x240 LCD display to
present a simulated analog clock face which fetches time from a local
host using the daytime protocol.
